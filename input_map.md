# Inputs Maps

Create a diverse mind map or concept map of ALL of the various inputs in your life (i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.) These are areas of your life, world, interests, circles. Break each of these elements down further, and get more specific. You should have some discoveries along the line of seeing different trends or yourself from a slightly different vantage point. How does this factor into your next version? Then Create another version, going deeper to explore these different trends.

Post both maps to your process website. We must be able to see this image clearly, including all of the details. You may have to upload micro and macro views of your map as images. You may also have multiple input maps. Infact, after doing one, you should have a better idea on how to make a second one, or another version that is far superior. Do the second (or third, or fourth) and post them all.

Please post this to your site
