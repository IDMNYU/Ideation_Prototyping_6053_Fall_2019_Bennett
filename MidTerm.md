# Lost Civilizations

Numerous civilizations have been lost in the course of human history due to any number of manmade or natural causes. Many others have been subjugated or otherwise subsumed into relative anonymity, resulting in a loss of languages and other cultural identifiers. Today, there are many examples of “stateless” and migrant populations seeking to escape political or religious persecution, natural catastrophes, and resource shortages.
 
You are charged with identifying a lost or struggling group, past or present, researching them, and conceiving a device or tool to assist them with their daily lives OR to fight whatever forces that led to their current circumstances.


### Examples of Lost or Struggling Civilizations:

* Maya
* Angkor Empire
* Hittite Empire
* Rapa Nui civilization
* Ancestral Pueblo culture
* Indus Valley civilization
* Moche civilization
* Native American cultures 
* Lost Colony of Roanoke


##### Contemporary:
* Occupants of Palestinian Territories
* Syrians
* Migrant populations from Central America



### Assignment

#### Part 1:
#### Due October 15th.

1. Research your chosen group. Answer the following questions through your research:

* What was the world like then? What sort of technologies and tools were in use? What are/were the typical jobs/vocation? Were they in short supply? What are/were homes like? A typical diet? 
* What is/was the political history? What or who is/was in power? Why are/were they in power? 
* What is/was the social history? How has it/did it affect things?
* What is/was the military history? How has it/did it affect things?
* What is/was the religious history? How has it/did this affect things?
* What are/were some of the highlights of this period/group? Struggles/low points? Challenges?

2. Assemble this documentation and use words and images to create mood boards, word lists, mind maps, image boards, twine, etc. You must (at minimum) create: *a mood board, image board(s), and word lists*.

3. Compile this research into an organized format. Begin by writing blurbs or short paragraphs. Print these out and cut them up into individual elements. Arrange them in the order they might be presented or discussed, structured as headings, subheadings, and content. How can one idea flow to another? Where you find gaps, develop the question that gap presents, then go back and do the research needed to fill those gaps.

You must include documentation and (10) different research citations.

Then create an outline of this presentation, titling each section and subsection. 

4. From this outline, you will then craft a 5 page paper (12 pt font, 1.5 spaces, 1 inch margins all around).

You can take different approaches to the style of the paper. It does not need to be like a term paper. One approach is to think of yourself as a reporter, that has been sent to this place and era to do a series of reports on. Each of those reports would be a different section heading in your paper, and you would then take a first person perspective. Another approach would be a 3rd person point of view, such as a National Geographic special.


#### Deliverables: 5-8 page paper, annotated bibliography with minimum 10 sources, moodboards, mind maps, storyboards, word lists, images, text, mapping organization documentation, outline


#### Part 2:
#### Due October 21st Noon

5. Explore “a day in the life” like for an adult female? Male? Children? Young Adults? Elderly?

Ideate on each of these. Give yourself time to think deeply. Develop a thoughtful and insightful questionnaire after compiling the research from the paper. Write out these questions, adding contextual information. 
 
Then, use these questions as creative launch points to develop adult [personas](Personas.md) - across a wide range of ages and social status of adults. You must create at least 4. Answer the questions and expand on them through the persona. Keep the personas abbreviated, but specific and logical for the era. (ie, Don't list every answer to every question.)

Develop data app profiles for each adult. Make sure that they are specific and logical to the era, while telling a deeper narrative of the time and struggles/challenges. These need to be a refined designed and visually appealing.


6. Ideate and create a mind-map of challenges and hardships. You may include what (possibly) lead to the group’s downfall. 

Then, include in your mind map, in a different visual treatment (font, color, shape): What created these challenges? You should be informed by your research. This must be evident.


#### deliverables: Questionnaires, 4 (minimum) personas, 4 dating profiles, High-Fi mindmaps


### Part 3:  Prototyping

Create a PHYSICAL device, simple machine, system, mechanism, service, company/organization/group that either makes daily life easier or enables the groups survival. It may be informed by contemporary knowledge. Yet, it can only be created with materials used in that time. (For example: They won’t have AR. but they can benefit from knowledge of systems, networks, communication structures)

What does it look like? How does it function? What is it a remix of? What is it informed by? What are its influences?

A. Create paper prototype <br>
B. Create low-fi physical prototype <br>
C. Create high-fi physical prototype <br>
D. Iterate high-fi physical prototype <br>

Your device/machine etc must develop through the iterations. This needs to be evident.

#### Due October 28: 

* A + B (bring to class & Post images to your site)
* revise, refine and iterate your personas
* revise + iterate your mindmap of the challenges of your lost civilization + people. This is to be a high fidelity mindmap document. Then, include in your mind map, in a different visual treatment (font, color, shape): What created these challenges? You should be informed by your research. This must be evident.
* Post on your site (by Monday noon) a list of 6 different people, organizations, leaders, politicians, celebrites from your Lost Civilization. Either write a short paragraph describing each person that is backed up by research, or link to such research. These are short, descriptive blurbs.
* other homework, as prescribed in the [schedule](shedule.md)

#### Due November 4:
* Create a pitch presentation as to why your device/machine is so important as well as how it works. This should include contextual information the group/era, as well as their challenges (don’t assume that we know. Give us reason to believe). You will have 5-7 minutes to give this presentation to the class. Practice beforehand.


### Tips for your presentation (seriously....read and review these. It makes ALL the difference....)

• Do not present to me. Look at your audience, your classmates. You are presenting to them.

• [THOUGHTS ON PUBLIC SPEAKING BY ZACH HOLMAN](http://speaking.io/) Click the links!!!

• Create a 5-7 minutes presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.)

• Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools - ie, notes)
Get familiar with your display preferences IN. ADVANCE. I'm. Not. Joking.!! I'm not kidding either. Borrow a cable from the student aids, and try it out on your own BEFORE class. Seriously. It makes all the difference in the quality of your presentation and your presentation nerves.

• If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to Crestron. Test this out on the projector before your present. See above.

• PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE
