# Lost Civilizations

Numerous civilizations have been lost in the course of human history due to any number of manmade or natural causes. Many others have been subjugated or otherwise subsumed into relative anonymity, resulting in a loss of languages and other cultural identifiers. Today, there are many examples of “stateless” and migrant populations seeking to escape political or religious persecution, natural catastrophes, and resource shortages.
 
You are charged with identifying a lost or struggling group, past or present, researching them, and conceiving a device or tool to assist them with their daily lives OR to fight whatever forces that led to their current circumstances.


### Examples of Lost or Struggling Civilizations:

* Maya
* Angkor Empire
* Hittite Empire
* Rapa Nui civilization
* Ancestral Pueblo culture
* Indus Valley civilization
* Moche civilization
* Native American cultures 
* Lost Colony of Roanoke


##### Contemporary:
* Occupants of Palestinian Territories
* Syrians
* Migrant populations from Central America



### Assignment

#### Part 1:
#### Due October 15th.

1. Research your chosen group. Answer the following questions through your research:

* What was the world like then? What sort of technologies and tools were in use? What are/were the typical jobs/vocation? Were they in short supply? What are/were homes like? A typical diet? 
* What is/was the political history? What or who is/was in power? Why are/were they in power? 
* What is/was the social history? How has it/did it affect things?
* What is/was the military history? How has it/did it affect things?
* What is/was the religious history? How has it/did this affect things?
* What are/were some of the highlights of this period/group? Struggles/low points? Challenges?

2. Assemble this documentation and use words and images to create mood boards, word lists, mind maps, image boards, twine, etc. You must (at minimum) create: *a mood board, image board(s), and word lists*.

3. Compile this research into an organized format. Begin by writing blurbs or short paragraphs. Print these out and cut them up into individual elements. Arrange them in the order they might be presented or discussed, structured as headings, subheadings, and content. How can one idea flow to another? Where you find gaps, develop the question that gap presents, then go back and do the research needed to fill those gaps.

You must include documentation and (10) different research citations.

Then create an outline of this presentation, titling each section and subsection. 

4. From this outline, you will then craft a 5 page paper (12 pt font, 1.5 spaces, 1 inch margins all around).

You can take different approaches to the style of the paper. It does not need to be like a term paper. One approach is to think of yourself as a reporter, that has been sent to this place and era to do a series of reports on. Each of those reports would be a different section heading in your paper, and you would then take a first person perspective. Another approach would be a 3rd person point of view, such as a National Geographic special.


#### Deliverables: 5-8 page paper, annotated bibliography with minimum 10 sources, moodboards, mind maps, storyboards, word lists, images, text, mapping organization documentation, outline


#### Part 2:
#### Due October 22nd

5. Explore “a day in the life” like for an adult female? Male? Children? Young Adults? Elderly?

Ideate on each of these. Give yourself time to think deeply. Develop a thoughtful and insightful questionnaire after compiling the research from the paper. Write out these questions, adding contextual information. 
 
Then, use these questions as creative launch points to develop adult [personas](personas.md) - across a wide range of ages and social status of adults. You must create at least 4. Answer the questions and expand on them through the persona. Keep the personas abbreviated, but specific and logical for the era. (ie, Don't list every answer to every question.)

Develop data app profiles for each adult. Make sure that they are specific and logical to the era, while telling a deeper narrative of the time and struggles/challenges.


6. Ideate and create a mind-map of challenges and hardships. You may include what (possibly) lead to the group’s downfall. 

Then, include in your mind map, in a different visual treatment (font, color, shape): What created these challenges? You should be informed by your research. This must be evident.


#### deliverables: Questionaires, 4 (minimum) personas, 4 dating profiles, High-Fi mindmaps
