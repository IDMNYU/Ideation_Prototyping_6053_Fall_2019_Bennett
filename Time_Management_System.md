## Time Management System

### Part 1: Experiment with various systems:

Between weeks 3 - 9, try out each of the time management systems during a weekday, one at a time. Document the method and post it to your Process Site under "time management system". 

Take notes on the following. We will discuss these in class:

* How you approached it: When did you set it up for? How did your structure it? 

* Did your execution go as planned? Did you have trouble with the system? Did you have trouble keeping the system? If so, why?

* What else did you notice? What changes occurred.

* What would another attempt or iteration include? What would you change to be more successful? Will you try this iteration? 

* Will you use this method again? How much or how frequently or when would you use this?

* Week 7 only: Create a refined hybrid system or develop a new system that helps you be most successful. What is this system? Discuss it and why you are going to utilize this moving forward? 

### Methods:

(information for each can be found in module 1)

* Eat That Frog (4 days)

* Stephen Covey's time management matrix (4 days)

* David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) (4 days)

* Neil Fiore's The Now Habit (3 days)

* Personal Kanban (4 days)

* Pomodoro Technique (3 days)

* Instead of managing time, manage your energy. Track your energy over 2 days. Then structure your next 3 days time based around when your energy is best, for each respective task. (5 days)

### Part 2: Practice

In weeks 10-13, put your refined system into practice. Document your successes and failures to your process blog under time management systems. By week 13, post final reflections and next steps.
